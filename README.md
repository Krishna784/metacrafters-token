# HelloWorld(HLW) Solidity Token
This is a simple Solidity smart contract named MyToken that represents a basic token with minting and burning functionalities. The contract is designed to manage a custom cryptocurrency called "HelloWorld" with the symbol "HLW."

## Overview
The MyToken contract includes the following features:

### Name and Symbol:

Name: "HelloWorld"
Symbol: "HLW"
Token Supply:

The total token supply is initially set to 0, but it can be increased through the minting function.
